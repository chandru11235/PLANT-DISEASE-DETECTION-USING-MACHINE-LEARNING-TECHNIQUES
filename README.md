# PLANT-DISEASE-DETECTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-TECHNIQUES


### ABSTRACT

- Crop diseases serve as a major threat to food supply. As a result of growing of
Robotic technology throughout the world, it has now become technical feasible to
leverage image processing techniques with deep learning to identify type of plant
disease from a sample photo. The mini project aims at building a Robo car type which
detects the lettuce plant leaf and leafy vegetable diseases. Using public dataset of 2,000
images of diseased and healthy plants, a pretrained model is implemented to detect the
type of disease the plant has and send the same massage to the farm owner. Identifying
diseases can lead to quicker interventions that can be implemented to reduce the effect of crop diseases on food supply.
